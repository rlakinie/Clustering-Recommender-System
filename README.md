# Recommender-System

Recommender systems are software tools that take information about a user, then predicting output to the user in terms of suggesting relevant items. The output is given in terms 
of relevant scores, which are responsible for ranking. Traditional recommender systems use collaborative filtering algorithms in social contexts to predict probable options for
a user based on past traits of similar users. However, with ever increasing volume of data, collaborative filtering recommender systems are highly computational intensive and 
thereby not scalable in big data context. A possible solution is to reduce dimensionality. But, even if we reduce dimensionality of features, we might still have many objects 
to compute the distance to. This is where clustering algorithms can come into play. This type of recommender systems can reduce high computational power needs. This project
seeks to develop a machine learning model to evaluate the usage of clustering for recommender systems.
